#Oh Sew Much

A transactional retail site geared toward women who are in the market to purchase a handmade toy as a gift for a young child.

Primary user Jeanette. Jeanette is paranoid and doesn't want to sign in to the site or receive our newsletter. She will still be able to purchase her handmade toys without logging in, but if she does log in, she will receive points towards discounts on future purchases and the ability to track her order history.

A logged in user will have access to their order history. A user will only be logged in from the landing page - via a view my order history button - or through the purchase summary page.

This project is designed for a small manufacturer or hand sewn goods. It is intended to be a retail outlet for goods to be sold with credit card processsing by Square.

It solves the problem of getting a small business owner's products to market without paying a fee to 3rd party retailers. It also gives the business owner the ability to add products to the catalog without having to directly modify the website.

This problem is experienced by many small business owners who cannot continually pay to have their site modified by web developers when product changes occur.

Our project solves this problem by storing the catalog in a databse and providing an admin interface for the business owners to manage their product catalog. It also addresses the ability to sell directly by incorporating credit card processing using Square's API and no local storage of credit card information.

This site uses the Square API for credit card processing and Lob for address verification.

It also uses several primary technologies including: JSON Web Tokens, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, Material-UI and Materialize, Babel with Brunch, Axios HTTP Library, Secure iFrames and 3rd party credit card processing.
